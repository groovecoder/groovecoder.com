<div style="text-align: justify;">isn't this basically what a blog is supposed to be about?</p>
<p>if T. Erl is still reading this blog, he would have a good deal to say about <a href="http://www.digitalproducer.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=21924">this</a>, maybe. while I think it's beneficial for code-cruncher types, the idea of being able to properly implement web services after supposedly only <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672325152/qid=1102259968/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-2838930-4792141?v=glance&amp;s=books">24 hours</a> of research is pretty crazy. and as Erl would agree, it would no doubt miss out on the full potential of what a Web Services platform can do. but quick-and-dirty IT projects are the bread and butter of some developers, and some successful businesses, too!</p>
<p>(as an aside, I have read that book, and it was very good as a starter. but please, please, if you read it, don't consider the single 20-page chapter on 'Typical Web Services Designs' as a good grounds for architecting an SOA with Web Services. it demonstrates only the typical hub-and-spoke integration approach, and <a href="http://www.serviceoriented.ws/">Erl's book</a> is far superior.</p>
<p>it looks like we bought our Altova XML Enterprise Suite a little too early up at the office. I've signed up for that ridiculous <a href="http://www.freeipods.com/?r=10907172">www.freeipods.com</a> site, because my geeky nature demands I have an iPod, but my wallet demands I don't spend money on it. <a href="http://www.altova.com/ipod_promo.html">Altova wanted to give me an iPod</a> all along!</p>
<p>just 2 news items, it seems. I guess it's typical blog-fashion, even if it is somewhat lacking in depth.<br />
