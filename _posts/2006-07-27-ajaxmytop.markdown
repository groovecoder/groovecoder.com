<p>I've been trying to work more on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ajaxmytop">ajaxMyTop</a> recently to smoothe some of my nervousness and anxiety from the last few weeks (source of which I'll reveal soon).</p>
<p>It's pretty nice to get back into it, but it's always frustrating when you're trying to improve something that already works, because you end up breaking it before improving it. I'm trying to move the filtering to occur before sorting so that the sorting process has fewer records to sort. But now I've broken the filtering and can't quite figure out why. I need a better way to debug the PHP side of things in Eclipse...</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
