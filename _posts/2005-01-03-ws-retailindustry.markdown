<div style="text-align: justify;">this is <a href="http://internetretailer.com/article.asp?id=13713">a great read</a> about the evolution of web usage up to and including/highlighting web services in the retail industry.<br />
</div>
<p>It talks about the benefits to retailers of outsourcing IT solutions (particularly fulfillment systems), and I think web services is something that enables organizations to easily outsource entire IT systems and processes.</p>
<p>I'd suggest everyone who needs some real-world, applicable evidence of the benefits of web services to read it, since most of the time you just hear the generic "we've used web services and they're just great.... .... ....?"<br /></p>
