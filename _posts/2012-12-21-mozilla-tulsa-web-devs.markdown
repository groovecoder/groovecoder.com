<p>I'd also like to see what other Mozilla remotees are doing in their local web communities ... ?</p>
<h3>Members</h3>
<p>We've added a bunch of great new members this year. I won't name any specific names for fear of forgetting someone, but our members have started spin-off groups like <a href="http://on.fb.me/reddirtwebdesigners">Red Dirt Web Designers</a>, Red Dirt Graphic Designers, and Tulsa DrupalDevs. We also have a number of WordPress designers and dev's - though they haven't made their own sub-group yet. But our members have <a href="http://www.meetup.com/OKC-WordPress-Users-Group/events/68676562/">presented at OKC WordPress</a> meetup and OKC.js <a href="http://okcjs.com/blog/2012/05/14/meeting-may-15-knock-out-your-browser/">May</a> and <a href="http://okcjs.com/blog/2012/06/18/meeting-june-19-final-fox-the-future-of-the-web/">June</a> meetings.</p>
<h3>Meetings</h3>
<p>Our average meeting attendance jumped when we moved from Fab Lab Tulsa to i2E location downtown. We went from ~12 in January to ~30 in November.</p>
<p>By far my favorite meeting was our <a href="http://tulsawebdevs.org/august-meeting-2/">August meeting</a> where we asked anyone and everyone to simply answer the question "What have you been working on?" in 5 minutes or less where the lightning talks ranged from Couch to django to WordPress to Node.js. I hope to do more meetings like this; even if we pick a single topic, I'd love to have multiple presenters for it.</p>
<h3>Co-working</h3>
<p>This year we finally - consistently - hosted (at and with Fab Lab Tulsa) coworking days (almost) every Friday. Attendance is anywhere from 1-2 to 10-12, with notable spikes anytime to dev's from consumeraffairs.com make the field trip. ;)</p>
<p>Many of our open-source project ideas come up during coworking days, and we give each other all kinds of technical advice - some of us have saved dozens of hours of work by simply asking a tech question around the tables.</p>
<h3>Hack Days</h3>
<p>Our hack days typically involved or included working on our open-source projects to prepare for other events. We started the year strong with Hack Days - doing one every-other-month to set up for our Spring Hackathon - but then we ran out of steam. Probably due to ...</p>
<h3>~Web Tracks</h3>
<p>This year we organized content for 2 "(sorta) web tracks" at established local technology events - a <a href="http://tulsaschoolofdev.com/talk-technology/gov-2-0">Gov2.0 track at Tulsa School of Dev</a>, and an <a href="http://techfests.com/Tulsa/2012/Tracks/HTML5/default.aspx">HTML5 track at Tulsa Tech Fest</a>.</p>
<p>Our Gov2.0 track was pretty much a flop - it's not our area of expertise, the overall event had poor promotion, and the event logistics were terrible.</p>
<p>The HTML5 track at Tulsa Tech Fest was really good. I got Yury to come over from OKC to speak, Patrick to give a fresh edition of his CSS talk from the previous year, and even got Olivier Bloch to speak about HTML5 for mobile cross-platform app development.</p>
<p>Both of our tracks lead into ...</p>
<h3>Hackathons</h3>
<p>Our <em><strong>Spring Hackathon</strong></em> focused on Gov2.0 and "open data" projects. In 2011 we - especially <a href="https://twitter.com/jwhitlock">John Whitlock</a> - made a couple of very valuable and noticeable "open data" projects: TRIF and the Tulsa Transit GTFS project. Motivated by their success, we tried to do more of the same type of projects. We also increased the duration from 24 to 48 hours. We made some cool stuff, but, IMO, the format was too long and the domain was too narrow.</p>
<p>Our 2nd annual <em><strong>Fall Hackathon</strong></em> snapped back to 24 hours and focused only on "apps" - any app would do. Mobile web, HTML5, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, whatever. We did *some* promotion but not so much to be stressful, and we still had a good turnout and made some good projects and progress. I think it was just about the Right Size and Scopeâ„¢ to be a sustainable yearly event.</p>
<h3>Startup Weekend</h3>
<p>A bunch of Tulsa Web Devs participated in this year's <a href="http://tulsa.startupweekend.org">Tulsa Startup Weekend</a>, creating projects like <a href="http://tfdd.co">TFDD.co</a>, <a href="http://wallcade.com/">Wallcade</a>, and <a href="http://picirus.com/">Picirus</a> (this year's winner!). I also started a <a href="https://github.com/tulsawebdevs/GeoNotes">GeoNotes</a> app aimed at Firefox OS, but our team was a bunch of backend dev's trying to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I wasn't confident enough to even show it at the closing ceremony.</p>
<h3>City Council Resolution</h3>
<p>Our Gov2.0 work attracted lots of attention from local civic interest groups, including Transit Matters, Tulsa Now, Tulsa Young Professionals, and eventually the Tulsa City Council itself. So, one of our city councilors contacted me about how to encourage and support the kind of projects and work we're doing. I suggested we should pass a <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=18G9agDB2myMGeInVqNySm6I_lBDHOgIqtcZI_FUFvC3qvMEUzZV70-J1sO1l">City of Tulsa Open Source Resolution</a> like some I had heard about from Portland, San Francisco, and Vancouver. It's still in draft stage but we hope to get it on a city council meeting agenda sometime next year.</p>
<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>We made too many projects to list them all, so just check out our <a href="https://github.com/tulsawebdevs">Tulsa Web Devs GitHub org page</a> or our <a href="http://tulsawebdevs.org/projects/">Projects page</a>. Our projects have spanned from local consumer interest to irc bots to wordpress plugins to open data.</p>
<h3>Mozilla?</h3>
<p>What does all this have to do with Mozilla? In running the group, I've tried hard to NOT make it all about Mozilla, but Tulsa Web Devs now boasts <em>1 Mozilla Contributor &amp; 1 Mozilla Rep, 2 Open Web Apps, and dozens of engaged Firefox users</em>. Now many members have asked me to bring <strong>MORE</strong> Mozilla activity into the group - to host a Mozilla hack day, bring speakers in from Mozilla, and help people contribute to Mozilla's websites. I'm looking forward to more collaboration between Mozilla &amp; Tulsa Web Devs in 2013!</p>
<p>I'd also like to see what other Mozilla remotees are doing in their local web communities. Got a good story to share?</p>
