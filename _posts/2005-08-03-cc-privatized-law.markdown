  content: that is a good point. I was going to type up a comment about your extended
    car metaphor, but indeed have been slacking a bit lately.

<div style="text-align: justify;">I wasn't going to post about this, but then I saw my tagline on my blog is a perspective on web services AND open source, so this is fair game.</p>
<p>I really only read the title of <a href="http://www.mises.org/story/1874">this article</a> and was reminded of my recent trip to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">CC</a>. I want to at least mention my perspective of CC as privatization of copyright law - an idea I've talked about before and fully support.</p>
<p>as I've stated in <a href="http://btetc.blogspot.com/2005/05/libraries-lotteries-and-again-with.html">long-winded and inelegant terms</a>, I think a repeal of copyright <span style="font-style: italic;">law</span> is not only possible, but is the most sensible course of action. as a true minarchist-borderline-anarchist, I see the perfect replacement to be a system of voluntary contracts under which individuals release their creative works as an opt-in approach. by that I mean a person who creates content can select a contract, or license, to apply to their work which legally binds the other individuals who use the work, but if no license is applied, the default status of the work is public domain, rather than copyright. (the Mises article describes a method of privatizing law that enforces the licenses)</p>
<p>as such, I'm officially a creative commons fanboy. do they have a travel mug I can purchase? whatever their motivations are, the final product is, to me, the perfect voluntary, freely-usable, easily-understandable system of private contract licenses that enable people to distribute and consume goods under their most agreeable terms.</p>
<p>anything that enables productive human interaction sans force is great.</div>
