  content: 'See the thing is that works don''t "start off" copyrighted and need to
    be placed into the public domain. I mean "in nature" ... we have of course created
    a copyright system in the U.S. where things are copyrighted upon creation, but
    that''s a peculiarity of the US.<br/><br/>Poor George Romero. You might not know
    that he made his horror classic "Night of the Living Dead" back when you had to
    attach a notice to get copyright protection. He released a print without it, so
    his film "accidentally" fell into the public domain, and as a result the poor
    guy was only able to make 17 more films so far.<br/><br/>I don''t follow why you
    want to know the "opposite of copyright", but like so many things it depends on
    the aspect you''re analyzing.<br/><br/>As a license (specifically one that states
    "all rights reserved") the opposite probably is "no rights reserved", i.e. the
    publicdomain. <br/><br/>As a means of promoting "science and the useful arts"
    -- specifically, by forbidding the sharing and copying of information, the opposite
    would be copyleft, which aims to promote science and the useful arts by *requiring
    sharing & copying.<br/><br/>As a type of property, which one naturally "owns"
    by virtue of having dreamed up the idea or pounded out the melody, well there
    really isn''t an opposite.<br/><br/>Here''s a fun one: as a metaphor by which
    ideas are treated like tangible property, the opposite of copyright is a metaphor
    under which tangible property is treated like ideas. There''s actually a term
    for this:<br/><br/>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_idealism'

<p>As a fun followup to my previous post, I thought I'd illustrate the same point using this very cool Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/comics1">comic</a>. After reading the comic, you should have a clearer idea of what the CC licenses are all about, right? In addition, I like the spectrum perspective shown in the opening and closing panels, as well as the 2nd-to-last panel explaining "Public Domain."</p>
<p>So here are the (rough) analogies I draw:</p>
<p>Copyright => Copyright EULA's<br />CC:Share-Alike => GPL, EUPL, etc.<br />Public Domain => LGPL, etc.</p>
<p>As I see it (and maybe Creative Commons sees it...?), <span style="font-style: italic;">Public Domain</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">and not GPL</span>, is the extreme opposite of Copyright. With that in mind, my order of preference is from most-free to least-free:</p>
<p>1. Public Domain, LGPL, etc.<br />2. GPL, EUPL, etc.<br />3. Copyright, <a href="http://wendy.seltzer.org/blog/archives/2006/10/19/forbidding_vistas_windows_licensing_disserves_the_user.html">Windows Vista License</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Addition:</p>
<p>I also just read a <a href="http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/blogs/debian_and_the_creative_commons">descriptive scenario</a> whereby new CCPLv3-SA licenses are incapable of ENFORCING their copyleft doctrine down the chain of recipients.</p>
<p>See, if I was Sam, I would just put work A into public domain and stop worrying about it. And if first recipient, Dave, wraps it in TPM, creating d[A], then that's Dave's work now. 2nd-recipient Bob may like d[A] more, but it's up to Dave to give him permission to modify d[A]. Bob can always come get A from me with no strings attached.</p>
