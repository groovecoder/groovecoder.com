<p>I want to share quotes I overhear at OSCON 2009. Most of these are from fellow SourceForgers ...</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a fan of the minimalist beauty of the electronic device.</li>
<p>
<li>Your API is not a beautiful fucking snowflake.</li>
<p>
<li>I am as asymptotically close to clean as possible.</li>
<p>
<li>You're going to be happy about not being happy.</li>
<p>
<li>I'm German, we know how to deal with crowds.</li>
<p>
<li>It doesn't matter, you eat it with rice and bread.</li>
<p>
<li>I fucked the grower to get this shit.</li>
<p>
<li>It's amazing what you can fit up your ass with a little practice.</li>
<p>
<li>I don't like my balls soaked in sugar syrup.</li>
<p>
<li>People shouldn't call each other tar pit.</li>
<p>
<li>There's nothing you can think of with an olive that I haven't already video'd and sold on the internet.</li>
<p>
<li>Is this the placenta thing?</li>
<p>
<li>All eating human flesh stories start with, "I was going to med school."</li>
<p></ul>
