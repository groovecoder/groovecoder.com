<div style="text-align: justify;">This blog will not be updated often, I think. I will try to keep discussion related to one or more of a few topics: Web Services, Open Source, some Economics and/or Politics and other geeky things.</p>
<p>If you already know about web services, you'll know the name, 'WS-RandomThoughts', is a play on the naming conventions used in 2g (2nd generation) web services technologies. see <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/#drafts">http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/#drafts</a></p>
<p>I'm abandoning my xanga, since it was and is basically limited to draining brain power from OSU students who somehow become convinced that their social interactions deserve eternal digital archiving rights, no matter how insignificant and pointless said interactions are.</p>
<p>if you came here from lamp5, don't take my opinions to represent all of the lamp5 community, as I am just one member, and probably one of the less inteligent members, too.<br />
