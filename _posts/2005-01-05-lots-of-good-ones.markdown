<p>okay, there were <span style="font-style: italic;">many </span>good reads today/yesterday, and I wish I could go into detail about each, but each time I start to write comments about one, I go off to read another and lose my train of thought. so here they all are.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.idevnews.com/IntegrationNews.asp?ID=150">Web Services re:EDI</a> talks about the co-existence of EDI and Web Services as means of doing B2B ecommerce, which is my focus at all times.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">WSDJ gives <a href="http://sys-con.com/story/?storyid=47665&DE=1">some practical tips</a> on deploying interoperable web services infrastrcuture(s).</p>
<p>idevnews also gives <a href="http://www.idevnews.com/TipsTricks.asp?ID=132">tips for delivering asynchronous web services</a>.</p>
<p>and <a href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid26_gci1041671,00.html">apparently</a>, more people in the IT industry are gaining knowledge about web services, though I haven't really encountered this.</p>
<p>I also read <a href="http://sys-con.com/story/?storyid=47666&amp;DE=1">a good exercise</a> in understanding BPEL, which is swiftly becoming my favorite WS-* specification, even if it is a glorified process-charting language like UML.</p>
<p>WSDJ (a great resource, obviously) has <a href="http://sys-con.com/story/?storyid=47668&amp;DE=1">an article on consuming services</a>, talking about RSS as an example of REST-based web services, server-to-server consumption, hybrid client/server apps (like World of Warcraft's UI aspect), and composite applications, which are the most interesting to me.</p>
<p>that's the lot for today. I had some good reads, but like I said, I couldn't keep focused on any particular one long enough to extend on it.<br />
