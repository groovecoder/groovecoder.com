<div style="text-align: justify;">I may have linked to <a href="http://computerworld.com.my/ShowPage.aspx?pagetype=2&articleid=435&amp;pubid=4&issueid=34">this article</a>, or a copy of it, before. I think it was called "The Killer Web Services App". this time it's touted under an SOA banner.</p>
<p>in any case, if I didn't already say so, I'd like to change the label from "<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The</span> Killer...App" to "<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">A</span> Killer...App." I'm with Bezos when <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail297.html">he says</a> that we are only just seeing the <span style="font-style: italic;">beginning </span>of these kinds of substantial new software programs that utilize the internet for base functionality and expand upon that base functionality for their app, which can be utilized in turn.</p>
<p>what I'm interested in finding out is what kind of platforms that killer app runs on. I can imagine that there is a case for a similar business that would be based on a LAMP stack and could thereby keep costs lower, and thereby offer similar or better services at a lower price.</p>
<p>also, I'm pretty sure I need to figure out a way to run said business while playing video games all day.</div>
