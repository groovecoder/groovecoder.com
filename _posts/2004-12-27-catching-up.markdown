<div style="text-align: justify;">okay, the newly acquired <a href="http://www.xbox.com">Xbox</a> and <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Games/Halo2/">Halo 2</a>, mixed with <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com">World of Warcraft</a>, <a href="http://www.red-man.com/">work</a>, <a href="http://www.lamp5.net">project</a> <a href="http://www.fancysoccer.com">s</a>, and <a href="http://www.osu-tulsa.okstate.edu/">school</a> have left me without a blog post in almost 10 days! so to catch up, here are a lot of articles in rapid succession.</p>
<p>Web Services AND open-source are positioned to drive packaged software prices down for the first time in a decade, <a href="http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20041221005315&amp;newsLang=en">according to META Group</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oetrends.com/news.php?action=view_record&amp;idnum=382">this article</a> really applies to all projects, not just open-source ones, and I may at some point write a post describing my disagreements with the first benefit it lists, bypassing WSDL, but it does a good job discussing XML benefits for developers.</p>
<p>more <a href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/tip/1,289483,sid26_gci1036649,00.html">evidence</a> that web services are expected to grow.</p>
<p>XInclude <a href="http://www.linuxelectrons.com/article.php/20041226094234779">is recommended</a> to be a new standard. new standards are almost always good in my eyes, and especially ones published by the W3C.</p>
<p>that's all for now. I'll try to get back to managing my time well enough to make posts every day or two. it might all depend on how long it takes me to beat Halo 2 campaign on legendary difficulty.<br />
