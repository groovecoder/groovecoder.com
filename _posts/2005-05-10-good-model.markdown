  content: 'Feel bad for not commenting in so long, but maybe it''ll get you to post
    more if I do:<br/><br/>1) PHPEclipse might be doing what you want with that. Haven''t
    looked in on them in awhile ... ZDE pretty much pwns eclipse for me.<br/><br/>2)
    As I think more about Lamp5, I see more overlap with various PEAR libraries. PEAR::XML_*
    .PEAR::SOAP, ... some of <a HREF="http://pear.php.net/packages.php?catpid=23&catname=Web%20Services"
    REL="nofollow" rel="nofollow"> these things</a><br/><br/>Maybe Lamp5 is just an
    Uber-PEAR, or a XAMPP style installer for PHP5 prebuilt with the necessary libs
    for ws, and some custom libs for website RAD<br/><br/>PS: wanted to expand the
    phc site into XenCart (a.k.a. ODR, if you remember what that stood for), but <a
    HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/" REL="nofollow" rel="nofollow">This</a>
    kickass project took half of that name ... hm.'

<div style="text-align: justify;">I like <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1813879,00.asp">this systinet approach</a>. my favorite OS model might be this one - using an OS project to generate buzz, interest, demand, and sales in another commercial product. I've thought the lamp5 approach could be very similar - creating a lamp5:Lumata::php:Zend relationship. and I think a lamp5 add-on to phpeclipse would be a cool OS project as well. though I think the core lamp5 framework will be the coolest. even if Lumata's commercial interests go down the tubes, I'd like to see an OS project like lamp5 take off so I can use it in consulting work.</div>
