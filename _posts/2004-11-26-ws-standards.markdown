<div style="text-align: justify;">so, in my excitement over Web Services, SOA, and a "standardized" distributed systems architecture, I have jumped the gun and been under some false assumptions. specifically, I blindly believed, without verifying, that the WS-* standards that I have been exposed to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0130497657/qid=1101529161/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-1754499-5008010?v=glance&s=books">thru</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131428985/qid=1101529108/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/002-1754499-5008010">my</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0130651966/qid=1101529231/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-1754499-5008010?v=glance&amp;s=books">research</a> were official W3C standards. but I read <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/articles/article.asp?liArticleID=135389&liArticleTypeID=1&amp;liCategoryID=2&liChannelID=20&amp;liFlavourID=1&sSearch=&amp;nPage=1">this blurb</a> that corrected me, at least with regard to the competing standards of WS-Reliability and WS-ReliableMessaging.</p>
<p>I also noticed on <a href="http://www.specifications.ws/">Erl's specifications.ws site</a> that the core XML and 1G Web Services were specifications from the W3C, and that the 2G WS-* specifications are listed as being published by IBM/Microsoft! I emailed Erl about this, asking if it was wise to promote possibly vendor-specific(?) standards, but I doubt he will get back to me. Not because I think he's in the pocket of IBM or MS, even though they "officially endorsed" his book, but more because he is probably swamped with frivolous email already.</p>
<p>I've spent most of the holiday pouring of Erl's book, in fact. I think it's a great chance for me to get caught up on SOA and implementation/integration strategies and tactics before getting back to work to put <a href="http://www.webmethods.com">webMethods</a> up in our Red Man systems. the webMethods reps have me convinced enough with their committment to SOA via WS, and have offered for me to give a talk at <a href="http://news.corporate.findlaw.com/prnewswire/20041111/11nov2004194627.html">their next integration conference</a>, which I will probably take them up on.</p>
<p>if I enjoy it, maybe I'll give more talks in the future...but I don't know.<br />
