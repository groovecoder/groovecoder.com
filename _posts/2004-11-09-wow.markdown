<div align="justify">the posts may either start to decline in frequency, or change in nature. I still plan to spend a good amount of time on open source and web services, but I'll also be crazily addicted to World of Warcraft. I've held off my plans to get an Xbox, so Halo 2 won't be damning all of my spare time, and I'll be dumping all my other games for WoW in an attempt to keep the gaming time down.</p>
<p>but for the next week I'm predicting very little productive code work on lamp5. hopefully I can get Tony to put together some good CMS features for the site, as he does not suffer from my gaming achilles. then I can start to easily create some meaningful content, giving the illusion of productivity, when in fact little or no new code will be produced. </p></div>
