<div style="text-align: justify;">the most important thing about <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2005/3/prweb222496.htm">this press release</a> has nothing to do with web services or email validation at all. rather, it made me aware of my need to register on that <a href="http://www.prweb.com/">PRWeb</a> site, so that if/when we are able to make announcements pertaining to lamp5, we can announce them on that site and they will get picked up by various <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts">google alerts</a>.</p>
<p>will just have to ensure that our press releases contain the most common buzzwords used by our target audience.</div>
