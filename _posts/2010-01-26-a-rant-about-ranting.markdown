<p>Disclaimer: this post is totally my own opinion and does not reflect anything from SourceForge at all. that's why it's here on this blog.</p>
<p>I'm angry and want to shoot my mouth off - perfect opportunity for a long-lost blog.</p>
<p>We - i.e., <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> are getting some crap for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/blog/clarifying-sourceforgenets-denial-of-site-access-for-certain-persons-in-accordance-with-us-law/">blocking sanctioned countries from our site</a>. That's fine - I'm actually ticked off about it too. And many people out there are making sound and solid comments about the action - not just the ones defending SourceForge; there are some good solid critical comments too.</p>
<p>But then you have people who say something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sourceforge, you suck! You suck so badly, I’ll hereby guarantee you that I’ll not only recommend *anybody* stay the heck away from you scumbags, I’ll actively let everybody know that you’re the scum of the earth. Shame on you! Shame!</p></blockquote>
<p>With love from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/users/pyalot">pyalot</a>. Well pyalot, since we're all good to judge and criticize each other, let's get started ...</p>
<p>So you are Florian Bösch. Okay Florian, let's see <a href="http://ch.linkedin.com/in/pyalot">here</a> ... you've worked at <a href="http://www.esystor.com/">Systor</a>(?), <a href="http://www.accenture.com">Accenture</a>, and <a href="http://www.dws.com">DWS</a>. Systor <a href="http://www.esystor.com/shop/IPS002.asp?LClssCd=000&LClssNm=&MClssCd=&MClssNm=">doesn't seem too keen on open-source</a>?, <a href="http://www.dws.com/EN/search/?SearchTerm=open%20source">nor does DWS</a>. Ah, looks like <a href="http://www.accenture.com/Global/Technology/Open_Source/default.htm">Accenture has some good open source work</a>; but what's this?! It's right alongside <a href="http://www.accenture.com/Global/Technology/Microsoft_Solutions/default.htm">Microsoft</a> and <a href="http://www.accenture.com/Global/Technology/Enterprise_Solutions/Oracle_Solutions/default.htm">Oracle</a> solutions?! OMFG! You are the scum of the earth for working with them! GRARRR!</p>
<p>Or, if I take an extra minute, I find you're actually <a href="http://pyalot.blogspot.com/">a stand-up guy</a> and <a href="http://dev.codeflow.org/">developer</a> and <a href="http://bitbucket.org/pyalot/">a good contributor to open-source</a>!</p>
<p>Couple lessons here:</p>
<ol>
<li>we're not anonymous on the internet anymore; I found all of this info on Florian starting from his sf.net user page</li>
<p>
<li>when we only look at a single facet of any news story or party, we get a very distorted view</li>
<p></ol>
<p>I actually sympathize with Florian's sentiments - blocking access from countries goes against the FLOSS ideal. But at the end of the day, SourceForge is a US company under US law. And if we're not law experts we should probably speak our opinion quietly or not at all.</p>
