<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.holoweb.net/%7Eliam/">Liam Quin</a> is asking open source developers <a href="http://www.advogato.org/article/820.html">a good question</a>. I don't have the answer, but I think I got a lot out of reading his article anyway. it has taken me aback a few times when smarter people than I talk about something replacing XML, but this article is the first time I encountered a type of suggestion to change, alter, or replace some of XML and felt like it was a valid idea.</p>
<p>I may leave some neophyte comments, but in my experience (B2B interchanges) XML is the best solution, and is only gaining momentum in that area, so for that area of applications, I can't think of anything better.<br />
