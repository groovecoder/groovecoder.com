When Microsoft showed <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20067859-264/web-apps-get-the-ultimate-endorsement-windows-8/">Windows 8 apps written with HTML, CSS, and Javascript</a>, a lot of Microsoft dev's - especially Silverlight dev's - <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">whined</span> <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/06/13/194254/Devs-Worried-Microsoft-Will-Dumpnobr-wbrnobrNET">expressed concern</a> about being abandoned by Microsoft.</p>
<p>My area - Tulsa, OK - is dominated by enterprise/Microsoft developers. I have heard horror stories of websites built by enterprise/Microsoft developers who know very little outside of Visual Studio. We're working on opening the web developer atmosphere up with stuff like <a href="http://tulsawebdevs.org/">Tulsa Web Devs</a> and <a href="http://tulsahackathon.com/2011">Tulsa Hackathon</a>, and we're trying not to scare away the couple of Microsoft dev's (like <a href="http://blog.phatboyg.com/">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/autrey">Chris</a>) who have come.</p>
<p>Philosophically, and as a recent Eclipse-to-vim convert, I know <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596519544">how much difference good developer tools can make</a>, and I know Visual Studio is way up there for many developers. This web standards update is great for Microsoft web developers. I hope the project gains momentum, and gets some more official Microsoft promotion - more than their equally good <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/">WebMatrix</a> project. (Which I heard about just a few weeks ago, even though I'm a web developer in a Microsoft-heavy area?)</p>
