<p>I have accepted a job offer from <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge.net</a>. I'm thrilled to death. This is basically my dream job. I won't say anything else beyond that until I get with them re: blogging etiquette. Hopefully I'll blog a little more frequently since I'll have cooler activities to blog about.</p>
