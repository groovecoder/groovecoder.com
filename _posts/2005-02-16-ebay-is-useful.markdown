<p><a href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid26_gci1059392,00.html">eBay is a really useful platform</a>. I liked the way this article used the word 'platform' to describe eBay. what used to be known as a "web site" is now a platform for building other "web sites" or any other system.</p>
<p>I especially liked the idea of how SAP was using eBay's web services API to sell off excess inventory, and I'm going to float the idea around here at RedMan until they give me a definite answer as to whether or not we could try it.</p>
