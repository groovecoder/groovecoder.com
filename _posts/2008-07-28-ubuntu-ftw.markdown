<p>I picked up an <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> CD at <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/home">OSCON</a> and have now installed it on my macbook pro. I have no qualms saying this version (8.04) is easily the best Linux experience I've ever had...</p>
<p>I had to connect to ethernet to get first batch of updates which also let me get <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper">ndiswrapper</a> and appropriate driver for my wifi card.</p>
<p>once I had that, wifi connected and it was a single apt-get command to get the proper <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup">bluetooth</a> module so my mouse would work. then I started downloading and playing with the new <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/compiz">compiz</a> stuff. I have to say, compiz effects blow away Mac OS X effects, though they're not quite as pragmatically integrated into everyday uses.</p>
<p>I fired up <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pidgin/">pidgin</a> and got connected to our company jabber and my google talk account. similar simplicity and ease with <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Evolution">Evolution</a> for company email (though I also started trying <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/products/desktop_download.html">Zembra Desktop</a> since OSCON).</p>
<p>our setup at sf.net is kinda unique in that we have our own sandbox sites that we can access and edit via webdav, so I did a simple apt-get for <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/davfs_ubuntu">davfs2</a>, made the necessary mods to /etc/fstab and I was able to vim edit some code. but I decided to go looking for linux php editors. I tried <a href="http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/">bluefish</a> and <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jedit</a> and liked jedit much more - its performance with the webdav-mounted dir was much better.</p>
<p>I also exported my del.icio.us bookmarks and imported them over into Ubuntu firefox. and I installed <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GnomeDo">GnomeDo</a> because I'm a quicksilver junkie.</p>
<p>total time was probably 2 hours or so - much better than any of my other previous jaunts into Linux. large credit to the high-quality <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/">ubuntu wiki</a>.</p>
<p>so I'm thinking to try out a full day of ubuntu tomorrow. my only concern is webex, though there is a native Linux client.</p>
