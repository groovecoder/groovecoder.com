<div style="text-align: justify;">I was sent on some <a href="http://www.looselycoupled.com/blog/lc00aa00074.html">great reads</a> yesterday and today by a nifty link in my great <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts">google alerts</a>. apparently someone is already out there championing some advantages of PHP over J2EE, and it's great that a large part of their argument rests on the fact that "everything talks SOAP/HTTP... So where is the application server of the future? It is a big text pump that is embedded in the various endpoints of an enterprise. There is nothing in the middle."</p>
<p>'big text pump' would be a great way to summarize how languages like Perl and, to a lesser extent, PHP started. this was really enlightening to me to think of web services in this way. after all, even with all the DOM vs. SAX and in-memory vs. file-parsing, etc....XML is text. and when you're talking about advanced Web Services...it's a LOT of text. so being able to handle text files easily and efficiently is a huge advantage of PHP over heavier app platforms like J2EE and .NET even. in theory, a stripped-down lamp5 box will blow away a J2EE app server on text handling, ie. Web Services. the ease of using the text is evident by the simplicity of the <a href="http://www.zend.com/php5/articles/php5-simplexml.php">extensions that handle XML</a>.</p>
<p>in addition to the cool angle on PHP vs. J2EE, I was made aware of <a href="http://www.activegrid.com/">ActiveGrid</a>, which I'm not yet sure whether to view them as a partner or a competitor of lamp5. I think ActiveGrid's purpose is to be able to create application servers that scale over a large number of small machines, as opposed to a small number of heavy machines. so I can see a partnership where ActiveGrid helps in developing lamp5 architecture such that it is suitable to spread over large numbers of small machines.</p>
<p>I'm going to be frequenting both of those blogs, so future postings of mine may come from links to theirs.<br />
