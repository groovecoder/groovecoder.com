<div style="text-align: justify;">sadly, I have neglected this blog while being overly busy with school and my multiple jobs, as well as my tendency to lose myself into WoW and other meaningless luxury indulgences.</p>
<p>I plan to return to regular posts if and when I am able to find a php web services project. as it stands now, I need to just stay on the prowl for one.</p>
<p>I still rely on <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts">google alerts</a> to keep me abreast of news on XML and Web Services, and I suggest everyone else do the same.</div>
