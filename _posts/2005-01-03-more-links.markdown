<div style="text-align: justify;">still being skimpy on the discussions, but there are a few items of interest.</p>
<p>Harry Fuecks has <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blog-post-view.php?id=220828">PHP predictions for 2005</a>, and even though I agree with his premise to date, I don't like his characterization of SOA. I think PHP developers should seriously consider at least learning about SOA so they know when to apply it, even though it doesn't apply to every app or script, it's the best tool that exists for its purpose.</p>
<p>Web Services are being used to <a href="http://sdtimes.com/news/117/story8.htm">load live data into Excel</a> spreadsheets, DUH!</p>
<p>that's really all I can report now. I did catch up on some other web services and xml news like XLink and such, but none of it really hit <a href="http://www.lamp5.net/">my area</a>.<br />
