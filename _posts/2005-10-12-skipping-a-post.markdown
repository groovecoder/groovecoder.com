  content: Aww, that's not fair. Sys-con publishes the Web Services Journal that I
    like so much.<br/><br/>Of late, they've actually done an okay job avoiding vendor-specific
    buzz.<br/><br/>But yes, read sys-con with care.

<div style="text-align: justify;">I had a post about 'SOBA' typed up, but I lost a large part of it, so I may have to just throw that one out and leave 'SOBA' with just a link and this summary:</p>
<p>Another buzzword does suck, but I like the notion of creating Business Applications (BA) out of Service-Oriented (SO) components. Like Matt's analogy of composing Lx shell scripts or utility programs out of the small, text-processing utilities already available. For SOBA, you lay out your business processes, and then you compose the implementation out of these or those small utility services.</p>
<p>The real post for today is a response to <a href="http://webservices.sys-con.com/read/136178.htm">'Open Servicing'</a> in <a href="http://webservices.sys-con.com/">one of my favorite mags</a>. The synopsis of the article is that <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/synapse">Apache Synapse</a> is an open-source platform for deploying web services in an ESB architecture, and that it's a great idea because consortiums of vendors tend to make standards and practices that are overly complex and borderline proprietary.</p>
<p>Some gems from the article:</p>
<p>"<em>It seems as though as soon as the open source community rallies around a technology, the IT industry starts taking it more seriously - and finds practical application for it. "</em><br /><em></em><br /><em><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"...</span></span></em>although technology standards are driven by a consortium, the consortiums are primarily representative of a handful of mainstream vendors with large market shares."</p>
<p>"The standards in Web services are becoming unmanageable...As a result, the Web services that are being developed in most organizations are not well thought out."<em><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></em><br /><em></em><br />I've never had to deploy an entire SOA since most of my web services work just involves integrating 2 heterogenous environments with statically discovered services. As such, I'm very guilty of the charge leveled in the last quote there. I would love to see Apache make this a great project to better deploy, manage, secure, coordinate, ... web services.</p>
<p>Right now, I think most developers are just implementing the simple stuff like SOAP and WSDL, or maybe some of the more vital and down-to-earth WS-* standards like WS-Security, WS-ReliableMessaging, WS-Addressing. Some pretty gutsy outfits out there may be doing the whole WS-Policy &amp; WS-BPEL dance, but like the article says, it's complex, confusing, and largely designed to fit into a handful of vendors' product roadmaps.</p>
<p>More and more, I think informed skepticism with regards to WS-* is in order. However, <a href="http://webservices.sys-con.com/read/133763.htm">un-intelligent and reactionary jabs from a single-vendor perspective</a> are not in order.</div>
