<div style="text-align: justify;">I thought the title was pretty fitting, although still very far-fetched. it does go thru a nice scenario of <a href="http://www.intelligententerprise.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=57702665">a real-world use of web services in making a business process more agile and adaptive</a>, so that's the plug-and-play part. but we're not yet to universal plug-and-play where you can instantly hook up into any service you need, as most services will always require at least a bit of custom work to get started. but as the standards used by the services gain widespread use, the work should get easier and easier.<br />
