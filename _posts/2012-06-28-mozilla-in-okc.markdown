<p>In the last couple weeks I've made two trips down highway 44 to give talks about Mozilla technology to web groups in Oklahoma City.</p>
<p><a href="http://okcjs.com/blog/2012/06/18/meeting-june-19-final-fox-the-future-of-the-web/"><img class="alignleft" title="OKC.js June Meeting Banner" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21969365/images/okcjs_final_fox_thumb.png" alt="OKC.js June Meeting Banner" width="150" height="225" /></a>First, I went to speak at the <a href="http://okcjs.com/blog/2012/06/18/meeting-june-19-final-fox-the-future-of-the-web/">OKC.js June meeting</a> about the various JavaScript API's and related technologies Mozilla is developing and promoting for the open web.</p>
<p>Jesse had told me the OKC.js group has started well and they were right. There were about 25 or 30 attendees. I covered a lot of material (see <a title="Presentations" href="http://groovecoder.com/presentations/">my presentations page</a>) and then gave away some swag - an Aurora laptop cover-sticker, shirts, and pens - to anyone who answered a quiz question about the content. Everyone likes shirts! In addition to questions about Gaming, Mobile, Apps and Boot to Gecko, I also got lots of questions and interest about our <a href="http://tulsawebdevs.org">Tulsa Web Devs</a> activities.</p>
<p>The following week I recruited <a href="https://twitter.com/craigcook/">Craig</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jake_maul">Jake</a> to help me give a "WordPress at Mozilla" talk at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/OKC-WordPress-Users-Group/events/68676562/">OKC WordPress June Meetup</a>.</p>
<p>There were about a dozen attendees and we used vidyo to do a conference presentation on our blogging infrastructure and operations (Jake), our theming (Craig), and finally I showed our BrowserID WordPress plugin. We got some good questions an interest, particularly in new One Mozilla theme and its accessibility features. I left a bag of pens for the meetup group - I had given away all my other swag at OKC.js.</p>
<p>OKC has a good web community that is starting to connect and do more - much like Tulsa. We have a full-time Mozilla employee in OKC. I'll plan to collaborate more between OKC and Tulsa web communities. Maybe float ideas of an OK Mozilla group or something. I'm already planning to talk to students at <a href="http://www.ftclass.com/about.php">Francis Tuttle Technology Center Web Design and Development program</a>.</p>
