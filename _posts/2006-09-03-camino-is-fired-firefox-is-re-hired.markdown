  content: I use Safari. It r0x0rz...most of the time. I also have Firefox as a backup
    in case a website (for some reason) won't work in Safari.<br/><br/>I too have
    an Apple theme on my Sony Ericsson. <br/><br/>-Clint

<p>Okay, while I admit it's very cool to <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/images/screenshots/desktop_screenshot.jpg">browse the web with a native Mac-style interface</a>, I can never go back to using <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/support/faq/#gen_exten">a browser without plugins</a>. I mean, even IE7 supports <a href="http://www.ieaddons.com/default.aspx?cid=home&scid=0">add-ons</a>. Camino is the kind of project that only an Apple <a href="http://www.answers.com/myrmidon&amp;r=67">myrmidon</a> would (or can!) love. There's absolutely NO way to justify tossing plugin architecture out of a product just so you can get the spiffy razzle-dazzle of Mac OS X inside your browser.</p>
<p>So while I'm easily an Apple convert (I have bluetooth'd an Apple logo over to my Razr to serve as my mobile wallpaper), I'm not a zealot.</p>
<p>P.S. I'm not sure why I don't use Safari.</p>
