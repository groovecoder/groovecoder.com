<p>Another quick google-search-turned-post to help others looking for a solution to this problem.</p>
<p>After my last Steam upgrade (Mac client) the community overlay stopped working in Team Fortress 2. This breaks a number of features, including the "Invite" button when creating a party. <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/440/discussions/0/828937420196342813/#c864969481994615745">This is the solution</a> that worked for me:</p>
<p>1. In Steam Library, right-click Team Fortress 2 and choose Properties<br />
2. UN-CHECK "Enable Steam Community In-Game"<br />
3. Quit Steam<br />
4. Re-open Steam<br />
5. RE-CHECK "Enable Steam Community In-Game"</p>
<p>Overlay starts working again!</p>
