  content: Couldn't agree more - esp. on the remote argument. Being on board with
    Firefox the first time for a launch day (as a contractor atm) made me really feel
    bad about not being in Ten Forward with all this awesomeness. How much I'd like
    that to change...

  content: "We believe in marketing fluff as much as anyone!\r\n\r\nWe don't believe
    in share? What a load of ...\r\n\r\nEvery decision to butcher the interface is
    ultimately justified by the notion that you have to target the mainstream. Just
    ask anyone in the design team but in particular Alex Faaborg. Amongst many I'm
    99% sure I've read comments from him making this very justification.\r\n\r\nGeez
    I've seen a lot of fluff marketing feelgood videos before, now I've just seen
    another one.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that, I still love Firefox, even when it leaks
    memory, I mean, it's tradition now. Firefox would not be the same without it consuming
    half the available physical RAM to keep less than a dozen tabs open :)\r\n\r\nI
    also got an added bit of love from Firefox 4. Apparently Mozilla believes in Blue
    Screens of Death now, all in the name of video acceleration."

  content: "Yeah I'm not usually into \"marketing\" but the Mozilla message is one
    worth branding and advertising well. Compare that video to the latest iPhone commercials
    - \"If you don't have an iPhone, well - you don't have an iPhone.\" Apple's message
    is smugness and snobbery and sadly, it works. Apple and Microsoft are trapping
    the mainstream into a closed, corporate and commercially-driven internet; why
    shouldn't Mozilla aim to help those users out; even by \"marketing\" means?\r\n\r\nWe're
    not internet hipsters trying desperately to avoid mainstream trends. The mission
    of Mozilla and Firefox is to make a better web for EVERYONE. If you don't like
    the mainstream UI you can fix it yourself. (http://lifehacker.com/#!5784783/how-to-fix-annoyances-with-firefox-4s-new-look,
    https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/firefox-4-ui-fixer/)\r\n\r\nWhat
    platform are you using with the memory leak? I've had it too on Mac OS 10.6 and
    noticed disabling Flash helps. Apple is right about some things! :) Also check
    support.mozilla.com to see if someone's already found a fix for your leak."

<p><img alt="Firefox 4 Launch Party in Ten Forward" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5252/5552106748_939041a846_m.jpg" title="Firefox 4 Launch Party in Ten Forward" class="alignleft" width="240" height="180" />I'm a couple days late, but I work remote so I didn't actually get to attend <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/donotlick/sets/72157626330284862/with/5551524021/">the Firefox 4 launch party</a>. Working remotely for Mozilla is a double-edged sword - it's a great opportunity to work for the best web company in the world from the comfort of my hometown, but we remotes miss out on the day-to-day awesomeness of company HQ. Even so, along with everyone I was mesmerized by <a href="http://glow.mozilla.org">glow.mozilla.org</a> for which fellow webdev's <a href="http://potch.me/">potch</a>, <a href="http://jbalogh.me/">jbalogh</a>, and <a href="http://howsehold.org/">chowse</a> deserve every compliment they get! All of engineering operations did some amazing work for this. Our VP said it best:</p>
<blockquote><p>The release day went off without a hitch - we shipped Firefox 4 to over <del datetime="2011-03-24T16:21:28+00:00">4 million</del> 6 million people, and if that wasn't enough - we shipped 3.5/3.6 to hundreds of millions more, *at the same time*, all without breaking a sweat!  Amazing websites were featured in news outlets such as the NY Times showcasing our amazing webdev talents (both in design and scalability), along with great dashboards from the metrics team that kept everyone on top of how the release was going over various mediums.  Users were delighted to have fantastic support articles all updated for Firefox 4 and we caught the few people attempting to game/DoS our infrastructure within minutes.  Sync more than tripled its new user rate and hummed along across multiple datacenters.  Just amazing across the board.</p></blockquote>
<p>What's also amazing is the sustained rate of the launch - we pushed 9M downloads on day #2 and we're still pushing 8k downloads per minute, so it looks like we may push another 10M today on day #3! If the other day was <a href="http://groovecoder.com/2011/03/04/good-day-for-mozillians/">a good day for mozillians</a> these last few days have been amazing - inspirational and humbling for this n00b webdev in the org. I can't say how proud I am to work for such a great company, so I'll let this video do it:</p>
