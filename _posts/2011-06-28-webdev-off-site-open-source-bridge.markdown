<p>Last week I verified the sentiment when I met a bunch of the folks I work with - many for the first time. Our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/morgamic/sets/72157626887463539/with/5856162206/">WebDev offsite (photos)</a> was great. We had a nice little Webdev unconference at the <a href="http://urbanairship.com/">Urban Airship</a> office on Monday, then we all attended, and a few of us spoke at, <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">Open Source Bridge</a>.</p>
<p>On Friday a bunch of us hacked on little projects and, as the conference wound down, we snuck into a room for a hack-n-tell. It showed me how much skill we have in webdev, and our evenings  together showed me our group's passion. I'm humbled by both.</p>
