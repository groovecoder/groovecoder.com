  content: '''Course shouldn''t you go for dB-neutral designs, as far as the php is
    concerned?<br/><br/>Sometimes I think it might be smart to cut our WS teeth on
    a LP5 platform (couple letters missing, see?), using the embedded SQLite from
    the command line.<br/><br/>Just thinking aloud. Sorry I don''t comment as much
    on yr blog, but my knowledge of the details of WS is limited.'

  content: yeah, the soft spot for MySQL is nearly as soft as the silky gelatin spot
    I have for PHP, so DB choice (should be) kinda irrelevant.<br/><br/>the only systems
    I've imagined for WS deployment would have pretty heavy DB for logging, etc. so
    I'd probably want a heavy-hitting DB server. though SQLite is AWESOME! we used
    it in that cd catalog (though the GUI was a .NET app). absolutely smokin'!<br/><br/>I
    try to comment on HE and OS licensing as best I can, but don't expect any deeply
    thought-provoking comments <a HREF="http://btetc.blogspot.com" REL="nofollow"

<div style="text-align: justify;">IBM got <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/3495151">this</a> cheer-leading help at internetnews.com, which is fine, because they're correct about lots of things. IBM wants to sell "SOA assessment services" just like I'd like to sell. well, they're calling it SOMA, and I'm calling mine, uh....advice?</p>
<p>in any case, with <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/info/zendcore/pr.html">IBM's new partnership with Zend</a>, it would be interesting to find out if IBM would ever be offering these assessment services to small businesses, and if they might pitch the Zend Core (including PHP) as an SOA platform. I, of course, think it's possible, but un-proven. and will hopefully move it into the "proven" column for my own sake, and it wouldn't hurt Zend and/or IBM to follow <span style="font-style: italic;">my</span> lead! ;) man, that would be sweet.</p>
<p>however, I would hope that Zend and/or IBM is as open to an SOA platform that uses MySQL as opposed to the Cloudscape database in Zend Core. don't get me wrong, I think Cloudscape is a great project and I really like that IBM is promoting it. I just have a soft spot for MySQL.</div>
