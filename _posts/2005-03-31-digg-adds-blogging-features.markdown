<p>so my blog will now basically be a luke-filtered digg site.</p>
<p>New to digg today: the ability to digg stories to your blog.  Choose a story that you wish to blog, then click "blog". digg will instantly post that story to your website.  If you donÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t like the way a story is worded, you also have the ability to rewrite your blog post.  Supported blogs:  Typepad, Live Journal, Blogger, Moveable Type, and WordPress. (note: you must be a registered user to see these features)</p>
