  content: those links are broken, so i'm not sure what you're talking about.<br/><br/>anti-marketing?
    huh? i don't particularly enjoy <i>doing</i> any marketing, 'cause it's annoying
    and i'm not real good at it.<br/><br/>i'm "opposed", I guess, to certain <i>kinds
    </i> of marketing that appear, and appear Very Frequently in the IT world<br/>-vague
    buzzword-oriented claptrap, vaporware<br/>-<a HREF="http://os.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/06/23/2027229&from=rss"
    REL="nofollow" rel="nofollow">deceitful</a> marketing<br/>-advertising that is
    stupid, or has the effect of making people stupid.<br/><br/>But this has nothing
    to do with my predilection for open-source software.

<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=1597">a great read</a>, in fact. better than I usually read from <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/">the other guys over there</a>.</p>
<p>in any case, I can't say that I've ever thought it out as completely or spoken it as articulately, but I've had that kind of gut feeling about the demand for open standards eventually driving proprietary vendors towards open-source.</p>
<p>but, lo, what is this? one of our very own <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog.jspa?blog=384&roll=0">open source champion</a>s is pitching <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog_comments.jspa?blog=384&amp;entry=83444">a marketing gimmick</a>, and it is received positively by the open source community? and by community, I mean, y'know...<a href="http://btetc.blogspot.com/">you</a>.</p>
<p>I thought the community/you had a pretty anti-marketing mindset...? could it be that marketing, as an act of conveying information in a targeted manner for maximum persuasive impact, is actually beneficial, even praiseworthy?</p></div>
