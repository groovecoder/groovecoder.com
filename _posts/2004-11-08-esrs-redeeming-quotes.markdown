<div style="text-align: justify;">I've always had an aversion to Eric Raymond, mostly because, as he himself admits, the FSF's "evangelism [has] backfired (associating "free software" with these negative stereotypes in the minds of the trade press and the corporate world)". I proudly include myself in the 'corporate world', as any reader of these postings will not contend against. and the ambiguitiy of the 'free-speech/free-beer' contrast is perhaps just a little too philosophical(?) for I and my business-oriented colleagues to easily accept.</p>
<p>but, I was pleasantly surprised to read <span style="font-style: italic;">some</span> of ESR's writings that at least show his recognition of traditional business practices operating in synchronization with open-source development practices...</p>
<p>"The real conceptual breakthrough, though, was admitting to ourselves that what we needed to mount was in effect a <em class="Emphasis">marketing campaign--</em>and that it would require marketing techniques (spin, image-building, and re-branding) to make it work."</p>
<p>"Support operations for commercial customers of open-source operating systems will become big business, both feeding off of and fueling the boom in business use."</p>
<p>I've attributed too much anti-business mentality to ESR, and owe him an internal apology in my mind. while I would still say the venom with which he attacks Microsoft and other <span style="font-style: italic;">proprietary</span> software companies is 'unnecessary roughness,' I can tell he really does appreciate the importance of <span style="font-style: italic;">commercial</span> software.<br />
