    rel="nofollow">a weblogger</a> now. It's really pointless so far but blech at
    least we're both all up ons now.<br /><br />bad) Dallas PHP/MySQL meeting is also
    Tuesday. So I'm likely to be at that one instead of this one. If we're all savvy
    and whatnot we'll hook up a video conference call. But we probably won't.

<div style="text-align: justify;">so, back to business of web services, after some lengthy, though productive, discussion of open-source licensing. along with more support for the anticipated growth in the Web Service industry, <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3441211">this article</a> acts as a nice Web Services Chapter 0. it talks about the building blocks, and the current, already large, web service landscape - of course using eBay and Amazon as the prime examples. it contains many good links on its points (I especially liked the article about BPM/BPEL).</p>
<p>in more personal/specific news, I showed the current state of the UPS Rate Selection Service php tool that I built to the Tulsa PHP Meetup Group. they seemed pretty interested, but I still have some work to do this weekend - I re-wrote the script using classes and am adding the correct documentation to expose it as a web service using the <a href="http://www.zend.com/php5/contest/contest.php?id=144&single=1">Webservice helper</a> tool. I'm dedicating this weekend to that, and World of Warcraft, so it should be very much done in time for Tuesday's meeting with the EDS folks.</p>
<p>I'll also need to put down some of the <a href="http://www.lamp5.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=19">MySQL 5.0 XML features that are in the works</a> in order to keep the lamp5 discussion related to MySQL, seeing as how Tuesday's meeting is the Tulsa <span style="font-style: italic;">MySQL</span> Meetup Group. I'm still a huge fan of MySQL, but am just discovering that it is not very involved with the Web Services I'm interested in.<br />
