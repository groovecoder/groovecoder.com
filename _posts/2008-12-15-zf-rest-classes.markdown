<p>Holy crap. I forgot that way back after Tulsa Tech Fest <a href="http://bluke.blogspot.com/2008/10/tulsa-tech-fest-2008-slides.html">I promised to upload some Zend_Controller classes</a> I wrote to enable RESTful behavior. I think the presentation did a decent job conveying their purpose and operation, so <a href="http://tulsaphp.net/Controller.zip">here, finally, are the classes themselves</a>.</p>
<p>If anyone does go look at them, feel free to comment/question here on this post about them.</p>
