<p>Novell has released SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10. I'm going to try this out very soon because I think Novell & SUSE are doing very well w/r/t usability and user-experience. In that respect, they're emulating Apple's approaches and designs, which r4wk.</p>
<p>It features integrated search via Beagle, and a 3d-accelerated desktop environment via Xgl. Only downside is that SUSE is always pretty large (5 CD's!), so it always takes me a long time to get a version downloaded and burned. I really need to get a DVD-burner.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.theolympian.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060716/BUSINESS/607160310">read more</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="http://digg.com/linux_unix/Novell_s_new_Linux_ready">digg story</a></p>
