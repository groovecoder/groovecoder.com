  content: 'It''s a fairly weak statement, in my opinion ... <br />"I believe that
    some think..." so the content has two levels of uncertainty.<br />And the content
    is kinda nebulous.<br /><br />At first glance -- knowing neither jack or s___
    about Erl -- it even seems FUDdy, although I couldn''t level that accusation without
    knowing your exact question and his answer in context.<br /><br />How an implementation,
    especially an open source one, could <i>undermine</i> interoperability is beyond
    me. You can make the implementation run on any machine, or talk to any piece of
    software whatsoever -- as long as you have the inclination, the source code, and
    the right to monkey with it.<br /><br />PS: what gave me away? My unparalelled
    literary and philosophic powers, or just the fact that I had clearly read every
    post on your blog? ;)'

  content: the philosophical powers were dripping thru the comments from the very
    start, and I thought I could see a couple dangling bytes from where you erased
    a typo caused by Otto.<br /><br />my original letter to Erl was:<br /><br />thanks
    for the continuous discussion. I just saw that OASIS approved the WS-Reliability
    standard (from 3 Japanese firms) in competition with WS-ReliableMessaging. at
    the same time, RM4GS (an open-source Java WS-Reliability implementation) was released.
    it seems that the firms are willing to foot the bill for drafting standards specifications
    AND developing implementations for the spec in order to encourage the adoption
    of the spec, and don't mind giving away all the work.<br /><br />have you noticed
    any trend in this area of the competing WS-* specs? for spec developers to release
    open-source implementations to encourage adoption of their spec?<br /><br />I
    totally agree...I was dumb-founded by Erl's assessment of open-source undermining
    interoperability.

  content: 'Luke, as I mentioned I am not involved with open source so I really could
    not provide you with an opinion. When I stated that "I believe that some think
    open source implementations may undermine the standardized interoperability that
    the WS-* platform promotes." I was recalling an article I had read some time ago
    in which it states: "The open source software movement, meanwhile, is not focused
    on pushing common technical standards, although many in the movement support such
    initiatives. Open source backers aim to create a market where software code is
    open to development and modification, which can in some instances undermine interoperability."
    Have a read yourself: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/04/30/irish_government_open_source/<br
    /><br />Regards,<br />Thomas'

  content: '1. Wow. Thomas Erl himself is looking at your blog, and I get to be the
    first to welcome him. That makes 3 and a half of us, including alter egos<br /><br
    />2.The clarifying context is appreciated; this article hails from the heyday
    of "open source vs. open standards" -- a debate I never fully understood, and
    a dichotomy that just doesn''t exist.<br /><br />Let me be clear: if OS development
    "undermines interoperability in some instances", we need to study those instances
    and prevent this in the future.<br /><br />But I also think esr nailed Schwartz
    at that time:<br /><br />"The Sun Community Source License claims ownership rights
    for Sun of any technology derived from the reference implementation ''or the standard.''
    So, in Schwartz''s world, a license which hangs the threat of a lawsuit over your
    head promotes competition more than source code that no one can take away from
    you.<br />...<br />nobody wants to be in the proprietary trap anymore, so Schwartz
    has been given the unenviable job of persuading the public that ''open source''
    is no better."<br /><br />Now Jonathan Schwartz is one of my heros, but I was
    mystified by that argument, because all other things being equal he ought to know
    that "open source AND open standards" is possible, desirable, and getting damn
    near mandatory in a lot of sectors.'

  content: Thanks for the comments, Thomas. I've really enjoyed the book, and also
    the correspondence we've had about the open-source issues.<br /><br />I think
    there is still a bit of substance to the Open Source vs. Open Standards argument,
    but it has now mostly been trimmed down to the actual problem, or at least, the
    actual problem I would see.<br /><br />I can see how some would be concerned that,
    because of its nature, open-source tends to fork projects and spawn new derivative
    projects, but I also think that normally its not a bad thing in regular-type open-source
    software programs.<br /><br />but when we're talking about wiggity-whack open-source
    web services, it would not be beneficial for a certain specifications' OS implementations
    to fork and inadvertently create their own specifications.<br /><br />this may
    be the concern that people carry with open-source approaches to Web Services,
    that it would foster deviations from the standards.<br /><br />I would like to
    say I have an idea for consolidating the 2 great features of the development models,
    but I don't...yet.

<div style="text-align: justify;">a minor effort to get some of the <a href="http://lukecrouch.blogspot.com/2004/12/i-blog-corrected.html#comments">very justified and well-founded pressure</a> off of my own back, and onto someone else's....</p>
<p><a href="http://www.serviceoriented.ws/">Erl</a> responded to my open-source inquiry. I don't know if he spoke for himself, or if he really did just speak for 'some' others...</p>
<p>"That's not an area I'm really involved with, so I'm probably not<br />
<br />the best person to ask. I believe that some think open source<br />
<br />implementations may undermine the standardized interoperability that the<br />
<br />WS-* platform promotes."</p>
<p>in a bit of blog-magic, I will magically turn the former 'Anonymous' commentor into MATT CROUCH and hopefully get him to sink his very shrewd fangs into Erl's statements.<br />
