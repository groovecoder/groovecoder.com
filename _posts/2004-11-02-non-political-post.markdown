<div style="text-align: justify;">balancing my new desire for consistent, if insignificant, blog posting and my equally "profound" drive to avoid direct discussion of politics in a web services/IT blog is a feat I only just now invented for introductory purposes to this post. sorry, I'm still learning how all this works.</p>
<p>but now that you are adequately convinced of my deficient writing and communication skills, we can skip straight to the meat:</p>
<p>I was amazed at the amount of market analysis that confirms my amazingly optimistic 'gut feelings' about web services. a few of the key pieces are <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/stats/article.php/3413161">a summary</a> of an official Radicati Group report stating that the market for web services solutions, management, integration, and security will be worth $6.2 billion by 2008. another is a <a href="http://www.cioupdate.com/news/article.php/2239561">brief article</a> showing web service project spending by firms has survived the economic slow-down, leading to a market of several billion dollars over the next few years, so say analysts.</p>
<p>with things like this going around, I find it hard to recognize other developers' interest in anything else. I'm having limited success and un-limited frustration finding more developers that would be willing to contribute free time and resources to an open-source project in this vein, but I've never doubted that with a good amount of persistence, some of those billions can make their way into my pocket, and yours, if you want to <a href="mailto:luke.crouch@gmail.com">help out</a>.<br />
