<div style="text-align: justify;">since I'm a self-proclaimed "fan" of the W3C, I feel obliged to report on thier latest activities, even if I don't really have any sort of take on the relevancy of their <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/articles/article.asp?liArticleID=136396&liArticleTypeID=1&amp;liCategoryID=1&liChannelID=171&amp;liFlavourID=1&sSearch=&amp;nPage=1">new standards</a>. I know it has to do with XML-binary, which some are (hoping?) to use in order to decrease the network and CPU processing power required to move around XML messages.</p>
<p>I for one have not experience any significant performance bottlenecks in my work with XML, but it is more due to the fact that our XML systems are not in production where there are millions of message being delivered. webmethods uses XML messages under the sheets, but it is all intra-app, so there would be no network stress to speak of. perhaps when we get more processes running simultaneously, we'll notice performance slow down due to processor resources being taxed.</p>
<p>until then, though, I don't anticipate using XML-binary to any extent.<br />
