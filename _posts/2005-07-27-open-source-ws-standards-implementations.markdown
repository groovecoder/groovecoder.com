<div style="text-align: justify;">see, <a href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid26_gci1111131,00.html">this</a> is the kind of stuff that gets me VERY excited. I had heard that Apache was being given the reins of some web services standards, and that OASIS was going to play peace-maker in getting Microsoft and Apache to the same table to work out issues with the licenses on those standards that Microsoft had penned.</p>
<p>I love the way this article described standards development and open-source development:</p>
<p>"from the frying pan of standards adoption into the fire of open source implementation"</p>
<p>I'm hoping that this becomes a tried-and-true pattern for web service standards - major work in designing solid standards, and then handed over for open-source implementation. although I confess I don't really have any experience with the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsrf">standards</a> <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsn">in</a> <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsdm">question</a>, nor have I even worked with <a href="http://ws.apache.org/">Apache's other web service standards implementations</a>. but I think I know enough about how Apache operates, and have enough excitement for web services to be "high" on the prospect of getting all kinds of open-source tools to integrate things.</p>
<p>but the dynamics of this kind of progress seem to have all the right components.</p></div>
